This database is powered by [Neo4j](http://neo4j.com/), a graph database that structures data in nodes (the icons you see in the visualization) and relationships (the links between nodes). To make this data easily accessible to everyone, regardless of the technical resources at their disposal, we have converted our original database into several CSV files, one per type of node and one for all the relationships for each project. You may download an archive in zip or torrent format. Please bear in mind that the archive is large, so if you know how to use BitTorrent, we encourage you to use it:

Between November 2017 and February 2018, ICIJ added data from the Paradise Papers investigation, including records from seven corporate registries (Aruba, Cook Islands, Bahamas, Barbados, Malta, Nevis and Samoa) and the offshore law firm Appleby..

On December 1 2017 ICIJ, with the help of Neo4j, incorporated a complete package for data exploration that includes a special Neo4j Desktop:

- The Offshore Leaks graph data
- Neo4j Graph Database, the engine powering the graph
- ICIJ Explorer, an easy-to-use data exploration application
- Neo4j Browser, an advanced tool for data query and analysis
- A guide that explains how to use Neo4j and examples to search in it

After downloading and launching Neo4j Desktop for ICIJ, all the required components and datasets are available. Once everything is installed the Neo4j Browser can be launched with the click of a button. An introductory guide that explains the structure of the data and how to use it for analysis and exploration will be available.

Download the right Neo4j Desktop executable from the following links:
