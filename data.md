Details on the four leaks that populate this database

---

The ICIJ Offshore Database shows relationships and networks among people or companies and offshore entities. Consider this database like a corporate registry where you can check information about a company and the people who played a role in that entity at a certain point in time. Roles include being a director, a shareholder, a beneficial owner, a trustee, among others.

The first installment of the database [was released](https://www.icij.org/offshore/icij-releases-offshore-leaks-database-revealing-names-behind-secret-companies-trusts) on June 14, 2013 as part of ICIJ’s Offshore Leaks investigation. More records were added on [January 23, 2014](https://www.icij.org/offshore/unlocking-chinas-secrets) (from ICIJ’s [China Leaks](https://www.icij.org/offshore/leaked-records-reveal-offshore-holdings-chinas-elite) investigation), on [May 9, 2016](https://panamapapers.icij.org/blog/20160509-offshore-database-release.html) (from ICIJ’s [Panama Papers](https://panamapapers.icij.org/) investigation) and on [September 21, 2016](https://www.icij.org/blog/2016/09/icij-publishes-leaked-bahamas-info-offshore-database) (from ICIJ’s [Bahamas Leaks](https://www.icij.org/offshore/former-eu-official-among-politicians-named-new-leak-offshore-files-bahamas) investigation).

Between [November, 2017 and February, 2018](https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/data-ever-added-offshore-leaks-database/) ICIJ released data from the [Paradise Papers](https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/) investigation, including records from the offshore law firm [Appleby](https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/icij-releases-paradise-papers-data-appleby/) and seven corporate registries: Aruba, Cook Islands, Bahamas, Barbados, Malta, Nevis and Samoa. The Offshore Leaks database contains information on more than 785,000 offshore entities and covers nearly 80 years up to 2016.

The sources of this database are four massive leaks received by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. The largest one measured by the size of the files comes from Panamanian law firm [Mossack Fonseca](http://www.mossfon.com/), one of the world’s top creators of hard-to-trace companies, trusts and foundations, whose inner workings were exposed in the April 2016 [Panama Papers](https://panamapapers.icij.org/) investigation. The data was originally obtained [from an anonymous source](http://panamapapers.sueddeutsche.de/articles/56febff0a1bb8d3c3495adf4/) by reporters at the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, who asked ICIJ to organize a global reporting collaboration to analyze the files.

The Panama Papers data published in this interactive website are records from Mossack Fonseca’s internal client database, including companies incorporated in tax havens and the people behind them. This is just a fraction of the complete leak, which amounts to 2.6 TB and 11.5 million files. This database doesn’t divulge raw documents or personal information en masse. It contains a great deal of information about company owners, proxies and intermediaries in secrecy jurisdictions, but it doesn’t disclose bank accounts, email exchanges and financial transactions contained in the documents.

You can also explore entities incorporated through [Portcullis Trustnet](http://www.portcullis.co/) (now Portcullis) and [Commonwealth Trust Limited](http://ctl.vg/), two offshore service providers exposed as part of ICIJ’s 2013 Offshore Leaks [investigation](https://www.icij.org/offshore). ICIJ produced the first version of the Offshore Leaks database with Costa Rican newspaper [La Nación](http://www.nacion.com/).

The third source of this database comes from a leak of the corporate registry of the Bahamas. From the 1.3 million files received as part of the [Bahamas Leaks](https://www.icij.org/offshore/former-eu-official-among-politicians-named-new-leak-offshore-files-bahamas) investigation, the database was expanded to include the names of directors and some owners of more than 175,000 Bahamian companies, trusts and foundations.

Between November, 2017 and February, 2018, ICIJ added data from the [Paradise Papers](https://www.icij.org/investigations/paradise-papers/) investigation, including client records from offshore law firm Appleby and seven corporate registries: Aruba, Cook Islands, Bahamas, Barbados, Malta, Nevis and Samoa. ICIJ incorporated data on more than 290,000 entities connected to the Paradise Papers investigation.

Data connected with Saint Kitts and Nevis was also part of the Appleby dataset. However, some of the Appleby records didn’t distinguish between Nevis and Saint Kitts. In the case of the corporate registry, the information is only connected to Nevis. The jurisdiction filter displays “Saint Kitts and Nevis” and the source distinguishes between the Nevis corporate registry and the Paradise Papers Appleby related data.
